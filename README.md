### What Does Oaksouls do Different?

Oaksouls reimagines the traditional top down RPG formula with combat, dungeon, level, and death systems inspired by other genres.

Combat requires careful thought and some degree of memorization (or note-taking) of enemy abilities. The player should know how many turns until the next enemy attack strikes, or risk taking large amounts of damage. These attacks can be safely observed through careful kiting, or in the official Oaksouls manual. All beings, including the player, only have five attacks or fewer- a basic attack, plus up to four additional abilities. Movement and some attacks are also restricted to the four cardinal directions, removing the need for a numberpad. Thus the controls are relatively simple, and everything in OakSouls can be done with just 12 buttons.

Although dungeon generation is fairly standard, every level has a soft time-limit. As turns pass, the dungeon grows darker and darker. Since your plant spirit requires light to both regenerate health, and survive, staying too long on any level (for example, to attempt to grind out XP to make the rest of the game easy), will result in an untimely demise as your tree starves to death. This also means, unlike most other roguelikes, that you do not need to eat your enemies’ corpses to survive.

Like almost every other RPG, leveling occurs when collecting enough experience, and provides some basic stat bonuses. It also allows you to choose one ‘trait’ which provides passive bonuses, or an automatically activating ability usually with some downside. Traits can also be abilities. Taking an ability trait allows you to trade out any of your existing abilities for it. These traits can greatly change the general gameplay loop.

On any given run, death is permanent. However, every run will confer bonuses to the player’s ‘forest’, which can unlock advantages such as starting on deeper dungeon floors (with the appropriate level), with different plant spirits, or on different dungeons entirely. Like Damned Dwarves, getting a better forest does not make the game easier. An expert will (usually) be able to clear every floor of the main dungeon and beat it with the basic plant on a new playthrough. A novice, even skipping the earlier floors, will struggle to make it to the stairs. In fact, since the earlier floors are easier, skipping them provides no gameplay advantage, All it does is save time by letting a player retry the more difficult parts more often.
